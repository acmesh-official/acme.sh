# Use QUIC.cloud DNS API

This uses the QUIC.cloud DNS API.

## Obtain an API key from the QUIC.cloude system.  If you do not already have one, once logged into QUIC.cloud:

- Select the Human icon at the top right of the screen and select **Edit Profile**
- On the left side of the screen, press the **API Access** item.
- Press the **Generate Key** button.  It will present you with a token you will need below.

## Use the API

You will need to provide 2 environment variables to acme.sh:

- **QC_API_KEY**:  This is the API Token value obtained in the QUIC.cloud screens.
- **QC_API_EMAIL**:  This is the email you used in your QUIC.cloud configuration
