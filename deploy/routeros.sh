# Here is a script to deploy cert to routeros router.
# Deploy the cert to remote routeros
#
# ```sh
# acme.sh --deploy -d ftp.example.com --deploy-hook routeros
# ```
#
# Before you can deploy the certificate to router os, you need
# to add the id_rsa.pub key to the routeros and assign a user
# to that key.
#
# The user need to have access to ssh, ftp, read and write.
#
# There are no need to enable ftp service for the script to work,
# as they are transmitted over SCP, however ftp is needed to store
# the files on the router.
#
# Then you need to set the environment variables for the
# deploy script to work.
#
# ```sh
# export ROUTER_OS_USERNAME=certuser
# export ROUTER_OS_HOST=router.example.com
#
# acme.sh --deploy -d ftp.example.com --deploy-hook routeros
# ```
#
# The deploy script will remove previously deployed certificates,
# and it does this with an assumption on how RouterOS names imported
# certificates, adding a "cer_0" suffix at the end. This is true for
# versions 6.32 -> 6.41.3, but it is not guaranteed that it will be
# true for future versions when upgrading.
#
# If the router have other certificates with the same name as the one
# beeing deployed, then this script will remove those certificates.
#
# At the end of the script, the services that use those certificates
# could be updated. Currently only the www-ssl service is beeing
# updated, but more services could be added.
#
# For instance:
# ```sh
# export ROUTER_OS_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES="/ip service set api-ssl certificate=$_cdomain.cer_0"
# ```
#
# One optional thing to do as well is to create a script that updates
# all the required services and run that script in a single command.
#
# returns 0 means success, otherwise error.
